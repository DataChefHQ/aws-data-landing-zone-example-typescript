# AWS Data Landing Zone Example

The **Data Landing Zone (DLZ)** is a CDK construct designed to accelerate AI 
and data-related projects. It provides an opinionated Landing Zone, laying 
the foundation for a multi-account AWS strategy, allowing you to focus on 
delivering data and AI solutions.

The DLZ can be deployed in existing AWS Organizations or used in greenfield 
projects. It supports setups ranging from small organizations with a few 
accounts to large enterprises with hundreds of accounts.

The CDK construct is available in both TypeScript and Python.

This repository demonstrates an example use case of the DLZ. For more 
details and available options, visit [datalandingzone.com](https://datalandingzone.com).
